Nine hatchlings have already emerged, and possibly three more may appear.\"\n\nThey added: \"The Moscow Zoo has been successfully breeding Siamese cobras for over 10 years.\n\nHowever, this year, for the first time, the incubator was placed on display in the 'Snake Charmer's Hut', giving every visitor the chance to see a baby cobra hatch.\n\nIn the incubator, the humidity is maintained at up to 90 per cent and the temperature ranges between 29 and 23 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe eggs spend over two months on sterilised vermiculite.\n\nWhen the hatchlings emerge, they crawl into the incubator's tray. They stay there for a day, after which they are moved to a temporary container.\n\nIn the container, the humidity remains the same, but the temperature can be slightly lower – 25-26 degrees Celsius.\n\nA local heat spot is provided, along with many necessary hiding places for the snakes. The hatchlings stay there for two to three days.\n\nThen, the baby cobras are transferred to a large terrarium. There, they live on a mix of mulch and gravel, along with sphagnum moss for humid areas.\n\nNaturally, this environment has even more hiding places than the container.\n\nInterestingly, the sex of the cobras depends on the incubation temperature. By regulating it, we can determine the ratio of females to males that will hatch.\n\nWe aim for average parameters to achieve a balanced group composition.\"\n\nThe Indochinese spitting cobra (Naja siamensis), also known as the Thai spitting cobra, the black and white spitting cobra, and the Siamese spitting cobra, is found across Southeast Asia.\n\nIt is listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.",

    "content": "A drug boss on the run for two years has been seized by police in Brazil after they tracked him down through his wife's social media posts about their luxury lifestyle. Wanted Ronald Roland, 50, was so determined to avoid police he had plastic surgery to disguise his looks. But he was arrested after police hunted him down thanks to his wife Andrezza de Lima Joel's Instagram posts about their non-stop spending. Police say the couple raked in more than BRL 5 billion (GBP 713,802) in five years selling drugs and laundering money. And, say police, huge parts of the profits were passed through de Lima Joel's modest bikini shop. In one day alone, reports local media, the shop banked BRL 200,000 (GBP 28,560) and then went on to buy its own company plane for BRL 3 million (GBP 428,320). The pair were arrested at their luxury holiday home in Guaruja, near Sao Paulo, on 2nd July after police found them thanks to de Lima Joel's Instagram posts about their glamorous life. She would often flaunt their holidays and shopping sprees in Paris, Dubai, the Maldives and Colombia allowing police to follow their movements. Police began tracking Roland when he moved into a lavish home in a high-end neighbourhood in Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, and began flaunting his wealth. Police spokesperson Ricardo Ruiz said: \"One day, a person arrives home with a BRL 500,000 [GBP 71,388] vehicle. A week later, with a BRL 1 million [GBP 142,777] vehicle. Another week, with a BRL 800,000 [GBP 114,222] vehicle. This caught the neighbourhood's attention.\" Huge amounts of money were siphoned through front companies to disperse the cash that came from selling drugs to Mexican cartels, say police. Ruiz added: \"Houses were acquired in the name of companies, whose partners were people without the slightest economic capacity to acquire properties, vehicles, aircraft. We found company partners, for example, who work in a restaurant but are partners in several companies that moved tens of millions.\" Police say Roland's web took in more than 100 front companies and 200 fake directors in everything from builders to car rental and cryptocurrency. Ruiz explained: \"What we found was the absence of economic and financial capacity of the wife who opened a bikini store that acquired vehicles, aircraft.\" Police say Roland has a criminal record going back to the 2000s. Ironically his first wife had caused his downfall in 2019 when she also unwittingly revealed their location with social media posts tracked by Interpol. Roland is the second Brazilian drugs boss to be seized this summer thanks to bragging Instagram posts by his partner. Cecilia Calixto's boyfriend Matheus Almeida was arrested after police began tracking her VIP lifestyle on social media. Calixto's only legitimate income was a tiny clothes shop in her mother's house but her posts revealed wild spending sprees way out of reach of the profits from her boutique. In just a few months, Calixto, 28, underwent a rhinoplasty, had silicone boob implants and revamped her curves with HD liposuction. She also ordered gold necklaces encrusted with diamonds, some designed by her and sent to bespoke jewellers for a one-off production. Calixto boasted about her fleet of luxury cars, say local media. The pair were arrested on 27th June after police identified them as the joint heads of a massive cocaine and hashish-running scam, reports local media.",

This enables important research work such as this to be carried out.\"\n\nIn the wild, the frog, Telmatobius coleus, can grow up to 20 centimetres (7.8 inches) from head to rump.\n\nIt is listed as 'Critically Endangered' on IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nThe study titled 'Acute hypoxia exposure rapidly triggers behavioral changes linked to cutaneous gas exchange in Lake Titicaca frogs' has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Behavioural Processes.",

My client did not even know that she was pregnant.\n\nWhen she suddenly held the bloody baby in her hands, she was in an exceptional psychological situation.\n\nIt was an accident, she dropped the baby. How the child ended up over the windowsill remains to be determined.\"\n\nIn the end, the court accepted the lesser charge of manslaughter but jailed her for seven and a half years, which was more than the three years the defence had demanded.\n\nHer legal team said they plan to appeal the verdict.\n\nNeighbours told local media how they had no idea Jovanovic was expecting a baby.\n\nOne said: \"Nobody noticed that the woman was pregnant. Recently she had changed and was no longer talking to us.\n\nWe thought she was stressed at work.\"",

Police then followed her through a series of plastic surgery ops and aesthetic procedures through her Instagram profile. In just a few months, Calixto underwent a rhinoplasty, had silicone boob implants and revamped her curves with HD liposuction. She also ordered gold necklaces encrusted with diamonds, some designed by her and sent to bespoke jewellers for a one-off production. Calixto boasted about her fleet of luxury cars, say local media. And when police linked her to drugs boss Almeida, it reportedly emerged that she had paid for the lot as his secret bookkeeper. Almeida had long evaded capture since he worked as a middleman and rarely handled drug shipments himself, police said. Instead, he used a small army of couriers and mules to deliver the orders to his customers all over South America, reports local media. Calixto, say police, used front companies and a technique called 'smurfing', using multiple bank accounts to spread the illegal cash around to avoid detection. The cash flow, say prosecutors, was enormous, with the gang constantly exchanging information about the progress of the money. As the main financial operator of the scheme, say police, Calixto managed the entire fortune made from drug sales. Over a year she received BRL 500,000 (GBP 71,900) in her account, with her partner being the primary recipient of the debits. Her clothes shop's annual gross revenue was estimated at BRL 70,000 (GBP 10,060), yet it received BRL 500,000 (GBP 71,900) between August 2020 and August 2021. In October 2021 alone, Calixto saw another BRL 300,000 (GBP 43,000) deposited into her bank accounts. Almeida, too, liked to show off on social media and was known for wearing a solid gold chain with a diamond-encrusted pendant in the shape of Christ's face. And, reports local media, he was a regular at celebrity and VIP parties where, police suspect, his drugs were supplied. Local media reports that 17 other suspects linked to the couple are also being investigated by police.",

    "altTextImg": "",
    "image": "",
    "content": "This is the agonising moment members of a squad of paratroopers are left permanently disabled after being doused with fizzy cider and burning quicklime in a brutal passing out ceremony. Footage of the troopers, part of the elite 14th Parachute Regiment, was recorded at their base in Cordoba as their trainers carried out a cruel hazing ritual that left many injured. As the soldiers kneel in a line, one of their drill instructors sprays them in the face with sparkling cider. Moments later, another hurls caustic white quicklime in their faces as they gasp and wince in agony. Meanwhile, their instructors, wearing hoodies with red beret-clad deathsheads and the motto 'Victoria o Muerte', or 'Victory or Death', cheer and whoop as they gag and retch. As the quicklime reacts with the liquid it gives off tremendous heat and, within seconds, many of the troopers are gasping for breath as the footage ends. It later emerged that the 35 graduating troopers were treated for burns to their throat, lungs, stomach, eyes and respiratory tract after the ritual on 17th May. Some are now suing the army over their injuries. Quicklime, or calcium oxide, is a caustic compound that if mixed with liquids generates rapid heat and can cause permanent eye damage. Local media said that it is believed flour was going to be used in the ritual but it was switched to quicklime without warning. The injured soldiers' lawyer Jeronimo Arganaraz told local media: 'They are between 20 and 25 years old. There were 35 people. Parachutist, they were shouting at them. And they had to answer always.' He added: 'While they kept their mouths open, they were given this powder that, in principle, should have been flour and ended up being lime. When it comes into contact with the moisture in the eyes, the mucus in the nose, etc., the lime is activated and this produces an extreme burning sensation that can cause very serious consequences.' Arganaraz said that many of the soldiers have been left with serious health problems since the ritual. He explained: 'Many tell me, Before I could stand running 25 kilometres and today, at kilometre five, I can't go any further. Before I had no problem, and now I can't do it anymore.' According to Arganaraz, many of those affected first refused to file a complaint for fear of reprisals by army brass who are desperate to cover up the scandal. He said: 'In some way, they are trying to punish the participants and prevent justice from intervening.' The Argentine army later denied any wrongdoing and blamed the ritual ordeal on 'confusion'. They said: 'As a celebration for the completion of the course, flour and cider were thrown on the 221 recently graduated paratroopers. To a group of 35 troops, due to an error by those who were supposed to carry the material, lime was thrown instead of flour.' They added: 'These personnel were the ones affected and immediately evacuated to the Cordoba Military Hospital, where they received medical attention and underwent tests. A small group remained under observation and was later discharged.' But the lawyer hit back: 'What would have been appropriate is for them to make, as public officials, the corresponding complaint to the agencies. They should have reported it and have Justice begin an investigation to determine whether or not it constituted a crime. But the way in which they acted, in short, was in a cover-up manner and an abuse of authority by carrying out coercion.'",

Stunning Elaine Victoria, 21, from Hamburg, Germany, gave her male followers hope when she announced in May that she'd separated from her husband. Now she's dashed them again by telling her 1.7 million TikTok and another 273,000 Instagram fans there's a new man in her life. Blonde Elaine became a social media sensation when she posted clips of herself dancing and lip-syncing at the supermarket. Now she's told her fans how she's finally found romance again. She said: 'I'm very happy and excited to see how it all develops. The year started off really badly, and I have a gut feeling that it will end very well.' But Elaine, now a full-time influencer, refused to name her new man and said he had no interest in social media. She would only say: 'His profile is just to watch my stories and stuff and stalk me a bit.' Earlier this year, Elaine said she and her husband, Jamal Edin El-Bahri, 25, had separated after just 20 months. She said at the time: 'I don't necessarily want a new boyfriend, but if it happens, then so be it.' Elaine quit her Aldi job after her clips catapulted her to fame in 2021. She said: 'I stopped working at Aldi exactly a month after the Aldi video went viral. At the moment I work exclusively as an influencer. If you look at me a year ago, I've become a completely different person. From life, from lifestyle.'",

Bento Benatti fell in love with art as a baby when his gran Vanusa left out some paints and canvases for him to play with and now he has been compared to famous American painter Jackson Pollock. Young Bento took to it instantly and now five years later, 30 of his canvases are on show at a public exhibition in Araxa, in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Videos of Bento at work show him using a bag of water dunked in paint to produce vividly coloured Impressionist-style flowers on one canvas. Another clip shows him blending sky blues and whites on a giant canvas that is taller than him. His proud mum Jacqueline said: 'In addition to painting, Bento loves playing with his brothers and friends, colouring, riding his bike, and taking swimming lessons. His favourite colour is red and he has a special taste for Japanese cuisine, especially sushi.' His grandmother added: 'I used to do crafts and so I had lots of materials at home. Little by little I started giving him some to play with and then he discovered painting. It's a great joy for me!' Araxa City Hall confirmed that the city-funded exhibition is open at the town's Municipal Theatre until 14th August. They said in a statement: 'From the age of 10 months, Bento demonstrated a great appreciation for artistic activities, creating his first works with the help of his grandmother, who gave him bottles of paint for him to pour onto some canvases. The results were surprising and, from then on, the artist improved his skills.' Laura Cristina Maximiano Alves, the coordinator of the Municipal Theater, who curated the paintings, compared them to Jackson Pollock's pieces, the most expensive of which, Number 5 1948, sold at a Christie's auction for USD 140 million (GBP 110 million) in 2006.",

Photographer Carlos Alzate says the mother of Jesus appeared at the Cerro del Mavecure, three hills above the Inirida River that have been considered sacred for millennia. The image shows what appears to be a shining white figure standing or floating above a rocky outcrop on the cliff face. As the sunlight hits it the figure appears to shine with its own light, local media reported on 23rd June. Alzate, who shared the snap, claimed on social media: 'The Virgin Mary appeared to me in the hills.' Locals say the Mavecure Hills are a natural wonder but also have deep cultural and spiritual meanings for the region's Puinave people. The photograph immediately sparked theories that the apparition was a holy sign. One social media user said: 'The Virgin of Inírida, now the believers are going to arrive.' Another said: 'That is a sign, something. It can happen according to the mythological belief of the Puinave people.'

Bizarre footage from the service shows the preacher as he is delivering his message from a studio pulpit in South Africa. But as he announces his spiritual teachings headlined '2023; Year Of Supernatural Flavour' he gets a more down-to-earth taste of life as a gunman swaggers in. In front of devotees all across Africa and India, the masked thief - armed with a handgun - forces the preacher to raise his hands while he frisks him for valuables. After finding his wallet, the hoodie-wearing crook then helps himself to the priest's car keys and mobile phone. Then he grabs his laptop from the lectern and walks off camera during the service from Emmanuel Community Church in the town of Verulam, KwaZulu-Natal. But he returns just moments later to give back the preacher's now empty wallet and then walk off with a widescreen telly screen. The footage only ends when the camera starts to wobble, apparently as the crook steals it. Police from the Reaction Unit South Africa (RUSA) say the bizarre hold-up happened on 27th July. Unit spokesperson Prem Balram said: \"The live stream was being viewed by individuals throughout South Africa and India when five armed men stormed the church and held up members of the congregation. The robbers made off with valuables and three vehicles.\" He added: \"RUSA recovered a maroon Toyota Corolla abandoned in Amatikwe in KwaZulu-Natal at approximately 20:28.\" Balram said no injuries were reported, although medics were rushed to the church.",

    "content": "German customs officers have seized a convoy of lorries from the UK loaded with construction equipment without declaring their contents for post-Brexit import taxes. Officials say they confiscated 31 excavator shovels, an excavator and a hydraulic hammer in the raid on the A3 autobahn near Nuremberg. They said the 37-year-old unnamed owner of three vehicles heading for Bulgaria 'was unable to provide proof of customs clearance for importing the goods into the EU with a total value of EUR 17,000 [GBP 14,880].' Newsflash obtained a statement from the Nuremberg Main Customs Office on Wednesday, 16th November, saying: 'Since BREXIT, Great Britain is no longer part of the EU and duties have to be paid when goods are imported. Apparently, not everyone understands that. On 8th November, a control unit from the main customs office in Nuremberg seized a convoy of vehicles from Great Britain at the Ludergraben car park on the A3 Wuerzburg - Regensburg, which had loaded heavy loads: 31 excavator shovels, an excavator and a hydraulic hammer. However, the owner of the three vehicles was unable to provide proof of customs clearance for importing the goods into the EU with a total value of EUR 17,000. Customs clearance was therefore 'rescheduled' by the customs officers and taxes were set at almost EUR 3,400 [GBP 2,973].' The customs officers added: 'Criminal proceedings were initiated on suspicion of tax evasion and a security of over EUR 4,500 [GBP 3,935] was set for this.' Customs police added that the unnamed '37-year-old paid both sums on the spot and was then able to continue his journey to Bulgaria.' The statement also said: 'The smugglers don't rest on Sundays either - but neither do the customs officers. This was discovered by the driver of a mobile home who came from the Baltic States and was checked by customs on 6th November at the Klosterwald car park on the A6 Nuremberg - Heilbronn. After being asked several times, the 44-year-old stated that he did not have any goods with him that had to be declared. His extreme nervousness alone made the officials doubt the statement. And rightly so - they found a total of 550 cartons of untaxed cigarettes in various storage compartments of the mobile home. The Munich Customs Investigation Office - Nuremberg office then took over the further investigations. The accused is in custody. The seizure prevented tax damage of almost EUR 20,000.'",

    "altTextImg": "",
    "image": "",
    "content": "Graffiti drawn by a knight from the Middle Ages has been discovered more than 500 years later in King David's Tomb in Jerusalem. A charcoal scrawling shows the name of the nobleman - Sir Adrian von Bubenberg - and his family crest. It was found on the wall of King David's Tomb on Mount Zion, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) said on 20th October. The Swiss nobleman is believed to have travelled to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage in 1466. The scribbling was discovered during a research project by the IAA that seeks to document pilgrims' inscriptions. The IAA admitted it could not be sure the graffiti was left by Von Bubenberg himself, as his son - also named Adrian von Bubenberg - visited Jerusalem too. The project has already uncovered more than 40 inscriptions in several languages by Christian and Muslim pilgrims alike. Von Bubenberg (1424-1479) is considered a national hero in his home country Switzerland for his role in military conquests such as the Battle of Morat. The battle was part of the Burgundian Wars, which were fought against the Burgundian State in what is now Lorraine, France and north-western Switzerland. He is buried in the Bern Minster in the Swiss capital. In a statement obtained by Newsflash, the IAA said: 'Written sources record that Adrian von Bubenberg came on pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1466. More than five centuries later, in the course of a research project documenting pilgrims' inscriptions, Michael Chernin and Shai Halevi of the Israel Antiquities Authority discovered a graffiti of his name and family emblem on a wall in the 'King David Tomb Complex' on Mount Zion, Jerusalem. The research results were presented yesterday in the joint conference of the Israel Antiquities Authority, the Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University, on 'New Archaeological Studies in Jerusalem and the Vicinity'. The Israel Antiquities Authority archaeologists carrying out the archaeological survey on Mount Zion, were not expecting to discover a graffiti inscription of Knight Adrian von Bubenberg, one of the admired heroes of Switzerland. The Israel Antiquities Authority Jerusalem Region have recently been carrying out a unique project in the 'King David Tomb Complex' on Mount Zion, focusing on documenting graffiti and ancient inscriptions left on the walls by Christian and Moslem pilgrims. They have revealed more than 40 inscriptions in different languages, as well as the family emblems of medieval knights. The decipherment of the hidden graffiti was made possible by advanced technological methods developed by the Israel Antiquities Authority for the research of the Judean Desert scrolls. These technologies, using multispectral photography, different wave-lengths invisible to the human eye, bring to light inscriptions that have faded and have been erased over the years.' Michael Chernin and Shai Halevi of the Israel Antiquities Authority, who lead the project, said: 'In the Mamluk period, between 1332-1551, the building complex adjacent to the traditional Tomb of King David, was owned by the Monks of the Franciscan Catholic Order. The building served as a monastery and a hostel for the western pilgrims, who left their mark on the walls. Technological methods developed today enable reading the faded inscriptions.' The statement continued: 'Amongst the inscriptions and graffiti, the researchers were very surprised to discover a charcoal inscription with the name and the heraldic emblem of the family of Adrian von Bubenberg, a Swiss military man and politician from the 15th century, admired to this day as a Swiss National hero. Von Bubenberg was born to a noble family in 1424, and after a long service as Mayor of Bern, he gained his fame in 1476, when he led the Swiss Confederate army in the Battle of Murten, and defeated the army of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who threatened the independence of Switzerland. Following this glorious victory over one of the strongest armies in Europe, the Swiss soldiers gained prestige as fierce fighters, who did not fear more powerful enemies. This reputation enabled Switzerland to maintain their independence amongst larger and aggressive neighboring states until modern times. After his death in 1479, and in gratitude for his protection of Bern and Switzerland, von Bubenberg was buried in a place of honor in the Cathedral of Bern. A statue of Adrian von Bubenberg adorns one of the central squares of Bern, and many streets in Swiss cities are named after him. Since his son, Adrian (II) von Bubenberg (1458-1501) also visited Jerusalem, it is not possible to determine whether father or son wrote his name, but the discovery of the Israel Antiquities Authority researchers, provides direct evidence for the connection between medieval Switzerland and Jerusalem.' Eli Escusido, Director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: 'The research carried out in Jerusalem embraces religions and cultures world-wide. Believers, pilgrims and visitors seeking to make contact with sanctified Jerusalem, left traces that the Israel Antiquities Authority researchers reveal and record on a daily basis. All these remains contribute to the fascinating picture, a taste of which we present in today's conference.'",

Schroeder was playing with the German national basketball team against their Italian counterparts in a match in 2018 when the crime is said to have happened. The security guard - named only as Manzor A. under local privacy laws - is accused of using a master key to get into the German team's lockers and rifle through the players' belongings. It was only after the game that Schroeder's teammate Karsten Tadda, 33, noticed that his MCM backpack, Gucci toiletry bag, and Bose sound box were gone. The items were worth EUR 950 (GBP 829), EUR 600 (GBP 524), and EUR 200 (GBP 175) respectively. Five days later, Schroeder went to police after he noticed his Audemars Piguet watch - worth a whopping EUR 61,000 (GBP 53,200) - was also missing. Cops later found Tadda's belongings in the suspect's car. But the watch was nowhere to be found. Manzor A., 32, appeared at Hamburg-Harburg District Court on 12th October. Tadda was unable to attend because of an important game. Schroeder did not attend either, as he now lives in Los Angeles, where he plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. Regarding the recovered belongings, the presiding judge said: 'Hard facts suggest that the accused had something to do with it.' But on the missing Swiss timepiece, he added: 'As for the watch, I don't have anything tangible at the moment.' Regarding Schroeder's non-appearance, the judge quipped: 'The gentleman has a lot of money. He must have forgotten the watch a long time ago.' The defendant exercised his right to remain silent during the hearing. The trial continues.",

Tiffany Burroughs had taken her three sons - aged one, two and five - to a trick-or-treat-style event at JJ's Restaurant in St. Charles, Missouri State, USA on 8th October. While her sons were collecting sweet treats, she noticed an odd package of gummy worms in a bowl. She did not think about it again until she got home and looked through what her children had brought back. Tiffany told local media: 'I remembered it when we walked through the door. I was like, 'Oh yeah, let me see that.' And I looked at it and I was like, 'Oh yeah, that's definitely not for kids.'' The package contained Delta-8 gummy worms. Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol is a psychoactive cannabinoid that can cause adverse effects, including hallucinations, vomiting, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, confusion, and loss of consciousness. One minor in the US is known to have died after eating them. After finding the package, Tiffany called police, who notified the restaurant. Police officers and the restaurant co-owner combed through the remaining sweets and found no more cannabis products. Lt. Tom Wilkison of the St. Charles Police Department told local media: 'We don't believe that at this time there was malicious intent, that somehow these gummy worms got mixed in with candy because they do look like candy.'

    "content": "A body-mod addict dubbed the 'Human Satan' has turned one of his hands into a claw with surgery to fuse two of his fingers together. Michel Faro Praddo - from Praia Grande, Brazil - has undergone more than 60 procedures and has around 85 per cent of his body covered in tattoos. But his latest body mod was apparently carried out by his wife Carol, also known as 'Mulher Demonia', or 'Demon Woman'. Gruesome images apparently show two bloody fingers being stitched together with surgical thread and a needle by someone wearing surgical gloves. Praddo said that his goal is to end up with a left arm that does not look human. He explained: 'The initial idea was to 'open' the hand after removing the ring finger. It would be a fork from the index finger to the middle of the hand, but we understand that it wouldn't be the way I wanted. My wife did some research on 'linked fingers' and, in the end, I was even more pleased with the result.' He explained that a few days before the new body mod, he had taped his two fingers together so that he would know what it would feel like. He said that fusing his two fingers together to make a claw was one of the most 'radical' transformations he has ever undergone. Praddo said: 'We are more fond of those modifications that we 'created'. Removing the nose, the ring finger and, now, the unification of the middle with the index finger are the most 'punk' ones I've ever done.' So far, his modifications include 'horns' implanted in his forehead, the removal of part of his nose, ears and even his ring finger, and the addition of silver dentures. He has also undergone liposuction and a tummy tuck, during which his belly button was removed. Praddo, known online as 'Diabao' ('Devil') and dubbed 'Human Satan' by the media, lives with his wife, who is also heavily modified. They have been together for around 10 years and started to undergo extreme changes to their bodies about five years ago. Praddo recently ate his own nipple as this stomach-churning video shows, with him seen chewing and swallowing it. The footage shows what looks like a ragged scar on Praddo's chest before he is seen holding his nipple between his finger and thumb. Then - to a soundtrack of thrash metal rock - he pops the nipple into his mouth and chews on it with his filed-down pointed teeth. Praddo said: 'Eating the nipple was something spontaneous, nothing premeditated. I had just taken it off and made a video. My wife was next door, and wanted to 'joke' with her.' He said the procedure was performed just before New Year 2021 and it was the last modification he did in 2020. Praddo had previously told Newsflash: 'I am always thirsty for body modification and I had to stop for a few months for personal issues, but then our Mexican friend and Modifier Gattoo Moreno came to visit Brazil and he offered to do a new modification... I chose to remove my ears and it was a very exciting experience because I felt I was rescuing something in myself, actually rescuing a part of my personality that others had put in a coma. I felt like I was coming back to life, and now I want more and more extreme body modification.' Despite his devilish appearance, Praddo has said that he believes in God. He said: 'I believe in God as a source of power, love, wisdom and various attributes that nurture life as a whole.'",

Though it is impossible not to admire the DIY efforts that went into making the vehicle, viewers do not need to be eagle-eyed to notice that the makeshift ride does not quite match up to the standards of the luxury Lambo it apparently tries to imitate. This becomes all the more clear when the couple completely remove the vehicle's roof before they climb into the not-so-supercar. The staged comedy clip purports to show a man who is caught by his wife with another woman before the couple argue and get into the sports car. A later clip with 8.7 million views also shows the couple getting into the vehicle, this time without lifting the roof off. And the latest clip, with 47,800 views, shows the car being pushed in reverse onto a road. Though the clips posted by 'siska ananda' do not show the car being driven, the convertible is reportedly in full working order, according to reports. Local media reported that the imitation Lambo was made by a farmer in Banda Aceh with a 150cc engine from a Yamaha Vixion motorcycle. The car's body is reportedly made of aluminium.

The study - of nearly 300 subjects - shows that while harsh sounds like traffic noise can worsen our mood, birdsong can relieve anxiety and paranoid thoughts. Newsflash obtained a statement from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in which they said (in English): \"When you next hear cheerful twittering of birds, you should stop and listen.\" They went on: \"Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and the Universitaetsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) have shown that birdsong reduces anxiety and irrational thoughts.\" Researchers examined how traffic noise and birdsong affect mood, paranoia, and cognitive functioning by carrying out a randomised online experiment with 295 participants. The institute explained: \"These heard six minutes of either typical traffic noise or birdsong with varying numbers of different traffic sounds or birdsongs. Before and after hearing the sound clips, the participants filled in questionnaires assessing their mental health and performed cognitive tests.\" The study's first author, Emil Stobbe, a Predoctoral Fellow at the Lise Meitner Group for Environmental Neuroscience at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, said: \"Everyone has certain psychological dispositions. Healthy people can also experience anxious thoughts or temporary paranoid perceptions. The questionnaires enable us to identify people's tendencies without their having a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, and paranoia and to investigate the effect of the sounds of birds or traffic on these tendencies.\" The study suggests that listening to birdsong can reduce anxiety and paranoia in healthy people, while it did not appear to have an influence on depressive states in the experiment. The statement added: \"Traffic noise, however, generally worsened depressive states, especially if the audio clip involved many different kinds of traffic sounds. The positive influence of birdsong on mood is already known, but to the best of the authors‘ knowledge, this study is the first to reveal an effect on paranoid states. This was independent of whether the birdsong came from two or more different bird species. The researchers also found that neither birdsong nor traffic noise influenced cognitive performance.\" The study explained: \"Birdsong is a subtle indication of an intact natural environment, detracting attention from stressors that could otherwise signal an acute threat. Taken together, the results suggest interesting avenues for further research and applications, such as the active manipulation of background noise in different situations or the examination of its influence on patients with diagnosed anxiety disorders or paranoia.\" Stobbe said: \"Birdsong could also be applied to prevent mental disorders. Listening to an audio CD would be a simple, easily accessible intervention. But if we could already show such effects in an online experiment performed by participants on a computer, we can assume that these are even stronger outdoors in nature.\" Simone Kuehn, head of the research group, said: \"We were recently able to perform a study showing that a one-hour walk in nature reduces brain activity associated with stress. We cannot say yet which features of nature – smells, sounds, color, or a combination thereof – are responsible for the effect. The present study provides a further building block to clarify this issue.\" The study's findings were published in the academic journal Scientific Reports on Thursday, 13th October under the title 'Birdsongs alleviate anxiety and paranoia in healthy participants'. The study was authored by Emil Stobbe, Josefine Sundermann, Leonie Ascone and Simone Kuehn.",

    "content": "This is the moment Spanish authorities break up an international drugs trafficking racket as they seize 80 kilos of hashish hidden in the cargo doors of a massive truck. A further 296 kilos of marijuana was confiscated after authorities discovered vacuum-packed marijuana buds hidden amongst heads of lettuce in a refrigerated truck. The gang - reported Spanish media - trafficked cannabis to Spain from Morocco on high-speed boats before transferring them to a fleet of trucks to distribute through Europe. A top secret police investigation - called Operation Vineyards run by Spanish National Police - raided a series of addresses in Cadiz and Malaga, local media reported on 10th October. Officials say the gang rented out a series of industrial warehouses where they modified speedboats with high-power engines and state-of-the-art navigation systems. A Spanish National Police statement said: “Once the boats were prepared, they were transported in trucks and trailers to the shores of Campo de Gibraltar.” Both the driver of the truck with cannabis in its doors and his companion were arrested while 19 others were arrested during the year-long operation. The 21 detainees were arrested for their alleged involvement in drug trafficking, smuggling and money laundering. They are also facing charges for belonging to a coordinated criminal organisation planning illegal activities, according to reports. Authorities went on to confiscate eight boats, four trailers, six outboard motors, three trucks, 4200 litres of fuel as well as EUR 16,000 (GBP 14,000) in cash, according to the statement. An asset investigation revealed that the organisation was in possession of a further 45 vehicles valued at EUR 1,472,000 (GBP 1,288,052) and a property worth EUR 150,000 (GBP 131,000).",

    "content": "A Brazilian man who called his son Adolf has been forced to cover up the huge swastika on the bottom of his swimming pool after prosecutors started an investigation. Wealthy history teacher Wandercy Pugliesi's admiration for the Nazis was exposed when police were carrying out a search as part of a kidnapping case using a helicopter. While carrying out the investigation, officers spotted the offensive symbol at the bottom of the huge swimming pool in the municipality of Pomerode in the southern state of Santa Catarina. The snap shows how the pool, together with its surroundings, resembles the flag of the German Reich in use from 1935 to 1945. Pomerode, where the property is located, has been dubbed the 'most German city in Brazil', given the majority of its residents are of German descent, with an estimated 90 percent fluent in German or East Pomeranian, which is a Low German dialect. At the time, the police decided not to take any action as the swastika was on private land and the owner could therefore not be accused of promoting Nazism. However, the Brazilian Israelite Confederation complained about the lack of action and denounced Pugliesi, prompting the state public prosecution service to order him to either remove or alter the swastika or face action. The public prosecution has since confirmed it has closed the case after Pugliesi provided evidence that he had altered the design, joining up the swastika so it resembles a square with a cross through it. However, photos still show tiles around the swimming area depicting a row of swastikas, which Pugliesi presumably did not have to change, given they are joined up. According to reports, Pugliesi had once put himself forward as a candidate for councillor in Pomerode. However, the centre-right Liberal Party for which he was running expelled him because of his Nazi swimming pool and his admiration for the Third Reich. It was also revealed that his admiration went beyond just having a swastika in his swimming pool, as he also owned Nazi-themed items including photographs, paintings, books and t-shirts, which were confiscated from his home in the 1990s. He fought a legal battle to get them back, claiming he was not a Nazi apologist - despite naming his son Adolf - and that they were merely for study, an explanation that was dismissed by the court at the time.",
